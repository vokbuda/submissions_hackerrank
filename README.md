# submissions_hackerrank
Tool for hackerrank submissions(includes also creation of python file with all solutions) - ADM

before start u should have **Python** and **Chrome** on your pc(I tested only on **Windows**)
## Execute the following instructions<br/> 

- in command line ```pip install selenium webdriver-manager PyPDF2 pyperclip```<br/><br/>
- in command line ```python start.py```<br/><br/>
- After completing all steps, you will see the following screen:<br/><br/>

- Insert the **number of pages** from HackerRank that you need to submit. In my case, I have _20 pages_, but I only need to submit _15_, so I will enter _15_<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>
- After that, the program will ask for your HackerRank **username** and **password**. <br/><br/>
- Enter your **credentials** (make sure you input them correctly, otherwise close everything and run  ```python start.py``` the second time),<br/><br/>
$${\color{green}Don’t\space worry\space about\space your\space credentials;you\space can\space check\space my\space code, and\space I\space won't\space send\space them\space anywhere.}$$

<br/></br>
- Once these steps are done, the program will start working (it takes approximately **23 minutes** on my laptop with 16GB RAM and an Intel i7 processor). Do not close the Chrome window during this operation. You can continue using your computer for other tasks while the program runs.</br></br>

- After the process is complete last two lines in prompt are about merged files and elapsed time, you will find the files _scripts.py_ and _merged_output.py_ in the same directory as _start.py_
